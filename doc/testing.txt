   dir       file       ERROR: This should fail if dst file exits.
   dir       dir        If dst dir exits copy *into* dir. If not copy using dst as name.

   3.2 Move

   file      file       simple move (rename) file to new location/name. ERROR if dst exists!
   file      dir        Moves file *into* directory
   dir       file       ERROR: This should fail if dst exits *and* is a file.
